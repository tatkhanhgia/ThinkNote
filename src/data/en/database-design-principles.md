## Database Design Fundamentals

Good database design is crucial for application performance, data integrity, and maintainability.

## Normalization

### First Normal Form (1NF)
- Eliminate repeating groups
- Each column should contain atomic values
- Each record should be unique

### Second Normal Form (2NF)
- Must be in 1NF
- Remove partial dependencies
- Non-key attributes should depend on the entire primary key

### Third Normal Form (3NF)
- Must be in 2NF
- Remove transitive dependencies
- Non-key attributes should not depend on other non-key attributes

## Indexing Strategies

### Types of Indexes
- **Primary Index:** Automatically created for primary keys
- **Secondary Index:** Created on non-key columns for faster queries
- **Composite Index:** Index on multiple columns
- **Unique Index:** Ensures uniqueness and improves performance

### Best Practices
- Index frequently queried columns
- Avoid over-indexing (impacts write performance)
- Consider query patterns when designing indexes
- Monitor and analyze index usage regularly

## Performance Optimization
- Use appropriate data types
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Optimize query execution plans
- Regular database maintenance and statistics updates
