# 🌟 ThinkNote - My Personal Knowledge Base 🌟

Welcome to **ThinkNote**! This is my personal repository where I compile, systematize, and manage valuable knowledge, ideas, notes, and experiences accumulated throughout my learning and working journey.

The goal of **ThinkNote** is to create an easily accessible, searchable, and expandable resource that helps me consolidate my knowledge, connect ideas, and share useful information.

## 📁 Project Structure (ThinkNote)

Your knowledge and notes can be organized within the `app/` directory (or other subdirectories depending on your classification preference). For example, each `page.tsx` file or other React components can represent a specific topic or piece of knowledge.

You might consider creating directories like `app/knowledge/react/`, `app/knowledge/backend/`, etc., to manage your notes effectively.
