## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans.

## Machine Learning Fundamentals

### Types of Machine Learning
1. **Supervised Learning:** Learning with labeled examples
2. **Unsupervised Learning:** Finding patterns in data without labels
3. **Reinforcement Learning:** Learning through interaction and feedback

### Common Algorithms
- **Linear Regression:** Predicting continuous values
- **Decision Trees:** Making decisions based on feature splits
- **Neural Networks:** Mimicking the human brain structure

### Practical Applications
- Image recognition and computer vision
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Autonomous vehicles

## Getting Started with Python
Python is the most popular language for AI/ML development due to its simplicity and rich ecosystem of libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.
