## What is Tailwind CSS?
Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.

## Key Advantages
- **Utility Classes:** Style elements by applying pre-existing classes directly in your HTML.
- **Responsive Design:** Easily build responsive layouts with intuitive prefixes like \`sm:\`, \`md:\`, \`lg:\`.
- **Customization:** Highly configurable through a \`tailwind.config.js\` file.
