## Introduction to Java

Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language that has been a cornerstone of enterprise development for decades.

## Core Concepts

### Object-Oriented Programming
- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit.
- **Inheritance:** Creating new classes based on existing classes.
- **Polymorphism:** Objects of different types can be accessed through the same interface.

### Collections Framework
Java provides a comprehensive collections framework that includes:
- **List:** ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector
- **Set:** HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet
- **Map:** HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap

### Memory Management
- **Heap vs Stack:** Understanding memory allocation
- **Garbage Collection:** Automatic memory cleanup
- **Memory Leaks:** How to avoid common pitfalls
